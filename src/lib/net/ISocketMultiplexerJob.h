    Called by a socket multiplexer when the socket becomes readable, writable, or has an error.
    The socket is readable if \p readable is true, writable if \p writable is true, and in error
    if \p error is true.

    The method returns false as the continue_servicing member of the returned struct if the socket
    should no longer be served and true otherwise. Additionally, if the new_job member of the
    returned pair is not empty, the socket should be serviced differently with the specified job.

    socket by calling \c addSocket() or \c removeSocket() on the
    multiplexer.  It must instead return the new job.  It can,
    however, add or remove jobs for other sockets.
