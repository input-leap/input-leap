\def LOG(arg)
Write to the log. This should be invoked like so:
\code
LOG(CLOG_XXX "%d and %d are %s", x, y, x == y ? "equal" : "not equal");
\endcode
Note that there is no comma after the \c CLOG_XXX.  The \c XXX should be
replaced by one of enumerants in \c Log::ELevel without the leading
\c k.  For example, \c CLOG_INFO.  The special \c CLOG_PRINT level will
not be filtered and is never prefixed by the filename and line number.

If \c NOLOGGING is defined during the build then this macro expands to
nothing.  If \c NDEBUG is defined during the build then it expands to a
call to Log::print.  Otherwise it expands to a call to Log::printt,
which includes the filename and line number.
