    returns when and what it does.

    Exactly what happens when daemonizing depends on the platform.
    <ul>
    <li>unix:
      Detaches from terminal.  \c func gets passed one argument, the
      name passed to daemonize().
    <li>win32:
      Becomes a service.  Argument 0 is the name of the service
      and the rest are the arguments passed to StartService().
      \c func is only called when the service is actually started.
      \c func must call \c ArchMiscWindows::runDaemon() to finally
      becoming a service.  The \c runFunc function passed to \c runDaemon()
      must call \c ArchMiscWindows::daemonRunning(true) when it
      enters the main loop (i.e. after initialization) and
      \c ArchMiscWindows::daemonRunning(false) when it leaves
      the main loop.  The \c stopFunc function passed to \c runDaemon()
      is called when the daemon must exit the main loop and it must cause
      \c runFunc to return.  \c func should return what \c runDaemon()
      returns.  \c func or \c runFunc can call
      \c ArchMiscWindows::daemonFailed() to indicate startup failure.
