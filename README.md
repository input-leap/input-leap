### What is it?

Input Leap is software that mimics the functionality of a KVM switch, which
historically would allow you to use a single keyboard and mouse to control
multiple computers by physically turning a dial on the box to switch the machine
you're controlling at any given moment. Input Leap does this in software, allowing
you to tell it which machine to control by moving your mouse to the edge of the
screen, or by using a keypress to switch focus to a different system.

At the moment, Input Leap is not compatible with Synergy.

Input Leap needs to be installed on all machines that will share keyboard and
mouse.

### What's different?

Whereas Synergy has moved beyond its goals from the 1.x era, Input Leap aims to
maintain that simplicity. Input Leap will let you use your keyboard and mouse
from one computer to control one or more other computers.

Clipboard sharing is supported.

That's it.

### Project goals

Hassle-free reliability. We are users, too. Input Leap was created so that we could
solve the issues we had with Synergy and then share these fixes with other
users.

Compatibility. We use more than one operating system and you probably do, too.
Windows, macOS, Linux, FreeBSD... Input Leap should "just work".

Communication. Everything we do is in the open. Our issue tracker will let you
see if others are having the same problem you're having and will allow you to
add additional information. You will also be able to see when progress is made
and how the issue gets resolved.

### Usage

1. Install and run Input Leap on each machine that will be sharing.
2. On the machine with the keyboard and mouse, make it the server.
3. Click the "Configure server" button and drag a new screen onto the grid for
    each client machine.
4. Ensure the "screen name" matches exactly (case-sensitive) for each configured
    screen -- the clients' Input Leap windows will tell you their screen names
    (just above the server IP).
5. On the client(s), put in the server machine's IP address (or use Bonjour/auto
    configuration when prompted) and "start" them.

You should see `Input Leap is running` on both server and clients.

You should now be able to move the mouse between all the screens as if they were
the same machine.

Note that if the keyboard's Scroll Lock is active then this will prevent the
mouse from switching screens.

### Contact & support

Please be aware that the *only* way to draw our attention to a bug is to create
a new issue in [the issue tracker](https://github.com/input-leap/input-leap/issues).

Always follow the template, it's there for a reason. Failure to do so will
inevitably result in a delay in the issue being fixed!

Please also see the IRC channels at the top of the README for other methods of
support.

### Contributions

At this time we are looking for developers to help fix the issues found in the
issue tracker.

Submit pull requests once you've polished up your patch and we'll review and
possibly merge it.

Most pull requests will need to include a release note.

See `doc/newsfragments/README.md` for documentation of how to do that.
