//! Microsoft Windows desk handling
/*!
Desks in Microsoft Windows are only remotely like desktops on X11
systems.  A desk is another virtual surface for windows but desks
impose serious restrictions:  a thread can interact with only one
desk at a time, you can't switch desks if the thread has any hooks
installed or owns any windows, windows cannot exist on multiple
desks at once, etc.  Basically, they're useless except for running
the login window or the screensaver, which is what they're used
for.  Barrier must deal with them mainly because of the login
window and screensaver but users can create their own desks and
barrier should work on those too.

This class encapsulates all the desk nastiness.  Clients of this
object don't have to know anything about desks.
