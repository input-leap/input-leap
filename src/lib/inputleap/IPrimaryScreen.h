    A hot key is a set of modifiers and a key, which may itself be a modifier.

    modifiers are logically down (active) and the key is pressed.  The hot
    key is released when the key is released, regardless of the modifiers.

    has the focus.  No other window or application should receive the key
    press or release events (they can and should see the modifier key events).

    the modifiers in any order or to require the user to press the given key
